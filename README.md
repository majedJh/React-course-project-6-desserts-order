# Desserts Order Project

Created 13/8/2025

My first ever self-created react project without following any tutorial, I made this project as a React version of that same project I made earlier using JS. I practiced more and more the states, up-lifting, props and children props, conditional rendering, reuseable components, immutablity and other concepts.

## What this app does

The user is able to browse the menu, add or remove desserts to his cart, select or change the quantity, see the total price then confirm or cancel checkout.
